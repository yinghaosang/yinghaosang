### Hi, I'm Yinghao 👋

Senior Software Engineer at TikTok, previously at [Kling AI](https://klingai.com). I studied AI at UPenn (MSE in Artificial Intelligence).

I like digging into gnarly production bugs in open-source projects. Recent contributions include reliability fixes for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — Telegram message delivery, gateway routing, CLI stability.

#### What I work on

- Large-scale distributed systems and backend infrastructure
- AI/ML product engineering
- Open-source tooling and developer experience
