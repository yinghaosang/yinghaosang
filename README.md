### Hi, I'm Yinghao 👋

Senior Software Engineer at TikTok, previously at [Kling AI](https://klingai.com). I studied AI at UPenn (MSE in Artificial Intelligence).

I work on large-scale distributed systems, AI/ML infrastructure, and backend engineering. In my spare time I contribute to open-source projects I use — lately [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw).
